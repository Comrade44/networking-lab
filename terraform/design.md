## Summary
VWAN is an Azure service that makes it simpler to manage network topologies, for example automating route tables and peerings between vnets. This setup will configure a hub-and-spoke network using VWAN

## Components
The two main components are the virtual WAN, and the VWAN hub. Hubs are Microsoft managed VNets that exist in each region in which you want connectivity, and are associated with the VWAN component, which is the overall collection of networks.
